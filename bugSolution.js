This solution focuses on resolving AGP version conflicts.  It requires careful examination of your project's `gradle` files.

1. **Identify the conflicting versions:** Look at the error message during the build failure.  It should indicate which AGP method is missing or incompatible.
2. **Check `android/build.gradle`:** This file contains top-level settings for the Android project. Ensure the `classpath` for the Android Gradle Plugin is compatible with the rest of your project's dependencies.
3. **Check `android/app/build.gradle`:** This file configures the application module.  Check the dependencies and ensure they are compatible with your AGP version.
4. **Check `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties`:** This file specifies the Gradle version. Make sure that the Gradle version is compatible with your chosen AGP version. 
5. **Update Versions:** Update the `classpath` in `android/build.gradle` and the AGP version in `android/app/build.gradle` to resolve inconsistencies. Use a compatible AGP version. Refer to the official documentation for compatible versions.
6. **Clean and Rebuild:** After updating the versions, clean the project and rebuild.  In the terminal, navigate to your project's `android` directory and run `./gradlew clean` followed by `./gradlew assembleRelease` (or `./gradlew assembleDebug`).
7. **Consult Expo Documentation:** The Expo documentation usually provides guidance on compatible versions of AGP, Gradle, and other dependencies. Refer to their official documentation for the most recent and accurate information.
